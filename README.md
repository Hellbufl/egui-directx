# Egui DirectX Renderer Implementations

Renderer implementations only. Libraries don't provide Win32 input handling. Consult Egui-Win32 companion crate
Helps with simplicity and keeping the libraries focused.
Workspace structure for the crates, refer to base Cargo.toml; all crates will be enforced to use a consistent version of windows and egui crates.
